      Your will pay over USD **$80,000** in four years in USA for education, let
      Dr. Thapa prepare you to maximize your investment.


      Dr. Thapa offers workshops designed to equip international students with
      the tools they need to thrive from day one in the USA. These workshops are
      conducted in-person (10-12 hours) in Nepal. The workshops are small-sized,
      with no more than 6-8 students per group, ensuring an intimate learning
      environment. Throughout these workshops, we delve deeply into a diverse
      range of topics, and students engage in multiple assignments with
      personalized feedback from me. By the end of the workshops, participants
      will be well-prepared to tackle academic and other challenges confidently.
