    text: >
      Applying to Universities in USA is a very easy process and I am going to
      show you how to do it for FREE. 


      There is a long wait for US visa appointment in Nepal, submit your
      application 9 months in advance. For example, if you want to go to USA in
      August 2025, apply by November 2024.
