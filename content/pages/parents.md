      As parents of an international student, you will have many things to
      consider as you prepare to send your child to USA.


      Many parents are concerned about the safety of their children once they
      arrive in the US.


      With any parent-child relationship, it is normal to worry about your child
      and think of them often â€“ but giving them space is very important to help
      them adapt and grow.


      One way parents can stay involved is by regularly scheduled check-ins.
      Plan a few weekly calls that works with the time difference. Remember that
      your children are busy with classes, homework, getting involved on campus
      and more.




      I send out a weekly email to all Nepali students and have meeting for
      Nepali students every Friday at 4 pm. Encourage them to attend my
      meetings.
